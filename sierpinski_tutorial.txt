Sierpinski Triangle Tutorial


Import the p5.js library 

In the setup function, create a canvas

Draw a circle in the middle of the screen. 

Move the circle into a function. Create a function that, given an x and y position, and diameter d, draws a circle. 

Now, lets make the function recursive. Call the function from within the function, shifting the circle in one direction and decreasing it in size. 

In case you get a  "maximum call-stack exceeded" error, add an exit condition where you loop only if the diameter is above a certain limit. 

Now make a second call that creates circles on the opposite side. So each circle will have two smaller ones around it. 

Now add a slider element above your canvas and make the diameter variable a function of the slider value. 

diameter=slider.value()

Finally, add a third direction, call the function recursively while shifting the circle down (or up) on the Y axis.

This is the famous Sierpinski Triangle, formed out of recursive circles.

Play with the number of recursive shifts you do and what kinds of shapes this creates. 
How is the recursive function creating complex shapes?
