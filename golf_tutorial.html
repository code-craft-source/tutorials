<div class="header">
Can you get your ball to the green, avoiding obstacles, using fewest strokes possible?<br><br>
Use vector principles to translate the touch-and-pull game mechanic into the ball's speed and direction.
Create this game using any theme you'd like, from standard green to under-sea or space-golf!
<br><br>
Here is an <a href = "http://www.learncodecraft.com/projects/golf.html"> example of a completed game</a>
and a <a href = "http://www.learncodecraft.com/projects/spacegolf.html"> space-golf version.</a>

<li>If you are coding outside of WoofJS.com (like in Sublime), insert the Woof_JS source tag into the &lt;head&gt;section of your project page:
  <p class="tab"><font color='blue' face="courier">
 &lt;script src="https://rawgit.com/stevekrouse/WoofJS/master/dist/woof.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</font>	</p>
Your code now speaks Woof!<br>
<br>
<li>Select a background for your course that matces your theme.
<br><br>
<li>Create your ball and destination (hole and green, the planet Earth). These can be images or just a circe.  Place them on the screen in opposite corners
<br><br>
<li>Create a new Line for your flight vector - the direction where your rocket will go. Give it a bright color. Hide it by default.
<br><br>
<li>When the mouse is clicked, show the vector line and make it go from the mouse pointer to the ball. Have it adjust as you move the mouse.
<br><br>
<li>When the mouse is released, have the vector line disappear and set the speed of the ball be the direction of the vector.   Hint: the two components of ball speed (xSpeed and ySpeed) are a multiple of the  xLength and yLength of the vector line.
<br><br>
<li>Add a forever loop, and move the ball by the X and Y speed components. Make the ball slow down as it travels across the course, so it should eventually come to a stop.
<br><br>
<li>Have the ball &quot;bounce off&quot; as it hits edges of the screen.
<br><br>
<li>Add 3-4 barriers on the screen. Use the &quot;bounce off&quot; function you wrote to have the rocket bounce off the barriers.
<br><br>
<li>Create obstacles and set them up in the middle of the course to block the ball.
<br><br>
<li>Create a variable that counts how many strokes the player takes. Show it on the screen.
<br><br>
<li>Play a sound when you hit the ball.
<br><br>
<li>Check when the ball is in the hole, play a sound, stop the game and show the player score.
<br><br>
<li>Keep working on the project and customizing until you are satisfied. <br>
Ask your teacher/TA to upload it to your public folder.
