<h2>Apple Catcher</h2>
<br>
</center>

<div class="header">
Its harvest season and the apples are dropping! Can your farmer catch them all?<br>
Start with one apple, then use an array to have multiple apples falling at the same time.
<br><br>
Here is an <a href = "http://www.learncodecraft.com/projects/apple_catcher.html"> example of a completed game</a>
<br><br>
Open Woof_JS here: <a href = "http://woofjs.com/create.html">http://www.woofjs.com/create</a>

<div class="main-body">
<ol style="margin-left: 10px;">

<li>If you are coding outside of WoofJS.com (like in Sublime), insert the Woof_JS source tag into the &lt;head&gt;section of your project page:
<p class="code">
 &lt;script src="https://rawgit.com/stevekrouse/WoofJS/master/dist/woof.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</p>
Your code now speaks Woof!<br>
<br>

<li>Find an appropriate backdrop (farm if you are catching apples, a circus tent if juggling pins) and add the url to the <font color='blue' face="courier">setBackdropURL</font> call.
<br><br>
<li> On the web, find two transparent images: an apple (or whatever you are ctching) and a farmer or another catcher. Save the URL's for the images.
<br><br>
<li> Add two image sprites. Use code from the <b>Sprites & Backgrounds</b> section of the Woof documentation.
Now change the <b> url: </b> attribute in the sprite objects to be that of the images you found.
<br><br>


<li>Add a forever function to your code. (Hint: look in the <b>Control</b> section of the Woof documentation)
This will take care of updating changes in the game in real time.<br>

<br>
<li>Inside the forever function, get your Catcher to move right or left if arrow keys are pressed.
Look in the  <b>Sensing</b> section if there is an instruction that checks if a key is pressed. Copy it and put it inside an <b> if </b> statement:
Something like:

<p class="code">
if (keysDown.includes('LEFT'))  {

      //move the catcher left 10 pixels

}
</p>

<li> Declare a text label for the score using a <b>Text</b> sprite.
<br><br>
<li> Create a variable (call it appleSpeed) and inside the forever loop, have the apple drop by that number.
<br><br>
<li> Check for apple hitting the bottom of the screen. If that happens, subtract 1 point and return the apple to the top of the screen.<br>
<br><br>
<li> Add a check for the catcher catching the apple. If this happens, add points, and also return the apple to the top of the screen.
<br><br>
<li> Show the score in the score label
<br><br>
<u>How do like the game now? Are you ready to have many apples falling at the same time?</u>
<br><br>
<li> Add an array called <b>all_apples</b>.
<br><br>
<li> Outside the forever loop, add an Every loop that creates a new apple every 2 seconds, and pushes it into the <b>all_apples</b> array
<br><br>
<li> Inside the forever loop,  add a forEach function that cycles through all the apples.
  <p class="code">
  all_apples.forEach ( apple =>  {

      //move the code to move the apple, check if the apple was
      //caught or hit the bottom of the screen HERE

  })
  </p>

<li> Increase the speed of the apples as the score gets higher
<br><br>
<li> Play a sound every time an apple is caught
<br><br>
<li>Keep working on the project and customizing until you are satisfied. <br>
Ask your teacher/TA to upload it to your public folder.
</ol>
