<h2>Flappy Bird Jungle</h2>
<br>
</center>

<div class="header">
Help your exotic bird fly through a trecherous jungle and avoid hunter's nets.<br>
You are getting more practice with arrays and manging multiple sprites - the nets - as well as "play-balancing" your game.
Have fun!
<br><br>
Here is an <a href = "http://www.learncodecraft.com/projects/flappy-bird-jungle.html"> example of a completed game</a>

<b>Directions</b></td>

</center>
<div class="main-body">
<ol style="margin-left: 10px;">

<li>If you are coding outside of WoofJS.com (like in Sublime), insert the Woof_JS source tag into the &lt;head&gt;section of your project page:
<p class="code">
 &lt;script src="https://rawgit.com/stevekrouse/WoofJS/master/dist/woof.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</p>
Your code now speaks Woof!<br>
<br>

<li>Find an appropriate backdrop (jungle, dessert) and add the url to the <font color='blue' face="courier">setBackdropURL</font> call.
<br><br>
<li> Create an image sprite for your bird and start it in the middle of the screen.
<br><br>
<li>Add a forever function to your code.  Inside the forever function, have your bird drop down continuously.
<br><br>
<li>  Then, if you are pressing a key, have the bird fly up.
Play-balance this so the bird looks like its flying.
</p>
<li> Add an array called <b>obstacles</b>.
<br><br>
<li> Find transparent images for your top and bottom obstaces -nets, pipes, dragons etc...
<br><br>
<li> Outside the forever loop, add an Every loop that creates a new pair of obstacles every X seconds, and pushes them into the <b>obstacles</b> array.
Make the nets come out at different heights by making the <b>y value</b> a random number. 
<br><br>
<li> Inside the forever loop,  add a forEach loop that cycles through all the obstacles.
  <p class="code">
  obstacles.forEach ( net =>  {

        //move each net to the left
        //if the net has reached the left side of the screen, delete it
  })
  </p>
<li> Declare a text label for the score using a Text sprite.
<br><br>
<li> If the bird passes thru the nets without touching, earn some points.
<br><br>
<li> Check if a net has hit the bird. If so, lose points. Show an "och" sprite or similar. If you have less than 0 points, end the game.
<br><br>
<li> Play a "squak" sound every couple of seconds. Or play a fun Brazilian soundtrack.
<br><br>
<li>Keep working on the project and customizing until you are satisfied. <br>
Ask your teacher/TA to upload it to your public folder.
</ol>
