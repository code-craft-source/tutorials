Here is a fun starter game to get familiar with sprite game mechanics and Woof_JS. Move your crab (or whatever sprite you choose) around the board to pick up as much food as possible before the timer runs out.
<br><br>
Here is an <a href = "http://www.learncodecraft.com/projects/crab_hunt.html"> example of a completed game</a>
<br><br>
Open Woof_JS here: <a href = "http://woofjs.com/create.html">http://www.woofjs.com/create</a>

<li>If you are coding outside of WoofJS.com (like in Sublime), insert the Woof_JS source tag into the &lt;head&gt;section of your project page:
<p class="code">
 &lt;script src="https://rawgit.com/stevekrouse/WoofJS/master/dist/woof.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</p>
Your code now speaks Woof!<br>
<br>

<li>Find an appropriate backdrop (ocean if you are doing fish, space if spaceships, etc) and add the url to the <font color='blue' face="courier">setBackdropURL</font> call
<br><br>
<li> On the web, find two transparent images: a hunter (crab) and a food (fish). Save the URL's for the images.
<br><br>
<li> Add two sprite images. Use code from the <b>Sprites & Backgrounds</b> section of the Woof documentation.

  Now change the <b> url: </b> attribute in the sprite object to be that of the crab,fish, alien etc images you found.
<br><br>


<li>Add a forever function to your code. (Hint: look in the <b>Control</b> section of the Woof documentation)
This will take care of updating changes in the game in real time.<br>

<br>
<li>Inside the forever function, get your Crab to move in 4 directions if arrow keys are pressed.
Look in the  <b>Sensing</b> section if there is an instruction that checks if a key is pressed. Copy it and put it inside an <b> if </b> statement:
Something like:

<p class="code">
if (keysDown.includes('UP'))  {

      //move the crab up 5 pixels

}
</p>


<li> Declare a <b>Text</b> sprite lable to show points.
<br><br>
<li> Add a check for the Crab catching the fish. If this happens, add points, and move the fish to a random spot on the screen.
<br><br>
<li> Check for Crab hitting the edges of the screen and react appropriately.<br>
<br>
<li> Create a timer variable and set it to however many seconds you want the game to last.<br>
<br>
<li> Add an <b>every</b> function, cycling every second. (Look in the  <b>Control</b> section.)
Inside the every function, decrease the timer by 1, and when the timer runs down, stop the game.
<br><br>
<li> Play a sound every time the crab gets a point.
<br><br>
<li>Keep working on the project and customizing until you are satisfied. <br>
Ask your teacher/TA to upload it to your public folder.
