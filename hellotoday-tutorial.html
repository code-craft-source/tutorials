<div class="header">

Use arrays to lookup the names of weekdays and months.
<br><br>
Here is an <a href = "http://www.learncodecraft.com/projects/hello_today.html"> example of a completed page</a>

<ol style="margin-left: 10px;">

<li>Create a standard HTML page with a button and two text labels (use <b>&lt;p&gt;</b> or <b>&lt;div&gt;</b>). Make sure the labels have <b>id</b> attributes and the button has an <b>onClick</b> attribute.
<br><br>
<li>When the button is pressed, run a function that will have one lablel say &quot;TIME&quot; and the other &quot;DAY&quot;
<br><br>
<li> Find a JavaScript function that can tell you todays Date. (its usually called the Date function) From that function,
  get the current day of the week represented as a number. Show that number when the button is pressed. (So if its a Monday, the label should show &quot;Today is day 1&quot;.)
<br><br>
<li> Create an array holding the names of all the days of the week so ["Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday" etc]
<br><br>
<li> Figure out how to lookup the day of the week in the array using the number you have. Show that name in the label instead. Have it say: "Today is Monday"
<br><br>
<li> Now do the same for the month. Get the number of the month from the Date function, setup an array with all the month names [&quot;January&quot;, &quot;February&quot;, ]
  and look up the name of the month using the number of the month.
<br><br>
<li> Your DAY label should now say &quot;Today is Monday and the month is April&quot;
<br><br>
<li> Add the day of the month and year, so your label says: &quot;Today is Monday, April 17, 2018&quot;
<br><br>
<li> Do the same for the TIME label:  show Hours, Minutes.
<br><br>
<li> Test if the hour is > 12, converted to 12 hour format and show AM or PM
<br><br>
<li> If the minutes are less then ten, add a zero to make &quot;8&quot; show &quot;08&quot;
<br><br>
<li> For extra credit, show seconds and have the page refresh automaticaly to act like a real-time clock.
<br><br>
<li> Style your page, make it look good, add any variations you'd like.
